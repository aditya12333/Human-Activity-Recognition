# Human-Activity-Recognition

### Problem Statement
Every people have smartphone. These smartphone contains many sensors. Two of the most important sensors are **accelerometer** and **gyroscope**.
**Accelerometer** measure the acceleration and **gyroscope** measure the angular velocity. Suppose we have collected the data from these sensors to predict the activity by human like running, walking etc.

" The main problem statement is to predict the human activities like, walking, running, sitting, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, laying."

### Data Understanding
The data is collected from 30 people in a lab manually by putting these sensors on their body while performing these activities. The data recorded with sensors in smartphone. These experiment was video recorded and to label data manually.
By using sensors, they have catured the 3-axial angular velocity from gyroscope and 3 axial linear acceleration using accelerometer with several variation. The data also contain the time series.
